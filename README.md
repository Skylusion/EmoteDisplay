## Instructions ##

Add this as a Browser Source and replace `yourchannel` with your Twitch username!

[https://www.instafluff.tv/EmoteDisplay?channel=yourchannel](https://www.instafluff.tv/EmoteDisplay?channel=yourchannel)

You can also add an optional value in the url to have the emote disappear after a set number of seconds. Just replace `timeoutInSeconds` with a number:

[https://www.instafluff.tv/EmoteDisplay?channel=yourchannel&timeout=timeoutInSeconds](https://www.instafluff.tv/EmoteDisplay?channel=yourchannel&timeout=timeoutInSeconds)

```
For example:
https://www.instafluff.tv/EmoteDisplay?channel=instafluff&timeout=3
```
